# Meal Recommender System

A machine learning-based meal recommendation system that suggests healthy recipes based on user preferences and nutritional requirements.

```

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ellie0826/meal_recommender.git
cd meal_recommender
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Download required NLTK data for text processing:
```bash
python -c "import nltk; nltk.download('punkt'); nltk.download('brown')"
```

## Data Files

The data files are not included in the repository due to their large size. You'll need to:

1. Create a `data/` directory in the project root
2. Add your recipe and review datasets:
   - `recipes.csv` - Recipe data with nutritional information
   - `reviews.csv` - User reviews and ratings
   - Other processed files will be generated by the preprocessing pipeline

## Usage

### Data Preprocessing

Run the data preprocessing pipeline:

```bash
# For recipe preprocessing
python src/data_preprocessing.py

# For review preprocessing (two-towers model)
python src/data_preprocessing.py reviews
```

This will generate processed datasets in the `data/` directory:
- `processed_recipes_all.csv` - All processed recipes
- `processed_recipes_healthy.csv` - Filtered healthy recipes
- `processed_reviews.csv` - Processed reviews with sentiment analysis
- `user_features_two_towers.csv` - User features for recommendation model
- `recipe_features_two_towers.csv` - Recipe features for recommendation model

### Exploratory Data Analysis

Open and run the Jupyter notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/01_eda.ipynb
```

## Features

### Data Preprocessing
- Recipe data cleaning and normalization
- Nutritional analysis with Nutri-Score calculation
- Ingredient processing and categorization
- Time and complexity analysis
- Health-focused filtering

### Review Processing
- Sentiment analysis using TextBlob
- Keyword extraction for health and taste preferences
- User behavior pattern analysis
- Two-towers model feature engineering

### Health Focus
- Nutri-Score based health assessment
- Dietary restriction identification (vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, etc.)
- Healthy ingredient detection
- Calorie and nutrition optimization
